# Xiang-Yu's Developmental Blog
## Week 1
In week 1, I was introduced to the world of web development and began to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I discovered that HTML is used to structure web pages, while CSS is used to add style and visual effects to those pages. With these two languages, I was able to create a simple recipe website for egg fried rice.
## Week 2
In week 2, I learned about semantic web development. This concept involves using HTML to create web pages that are not only visually appealing, but also structured in a way that makes them easy for search engines to understand. By using semantic HTML tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>, I was able to create a well-organized page that was easy for both humans and machines to read.
## Week 3
In week 3, I learned about key concepts that are necessary for creating modern, responsive websites. I learned how to create forms with HTML, how to use different positioning values in CSS, and how to use flexbox for powerful layout tools. Additionally, I learned about media queries, which enable me to create specific styles for different device sizes. Overall, the knowledge I gained in week 3 was crucial in helping me to create responsive and dynamic web pages that are visually appealing and functional.
## Week 4
In week 4, I learned about web responsiveness and started working on my assignment. Web responsiveness is the concept of creating websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. I learned about different techniques for creating responsive websites and best practices for creating responsive images and videos. After learning about web responsiveness, I started working on my assignment which involved creating a responsive and functional website from scratch. Overall, week 4 was a challenging but rewarding week where I gained a deeper understanding of how to create websites that are accessible, functional, and visually appealing on a variety of devices.
## Week 5
In week 5, I had an asynchronous lesson where I learned the basics of JavaScript. This programming language enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on websites. I learned about variables, data types, functions, and control flow, and how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to update the content of a webpage. With this knowledge, I can add interactivity and dynamic behavior to my web pages, making them more engaging and user-friendly.
## Week 6
In week 6 I learned about new concepts in OOP such as classes, objects, and inheritance, and the importance of encapsulation. In addition, I learned how to manipulate and traverse the DOM using JavaScript, add and remove elements, and modify content dynamically. This week helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript and taught me how to create more complex and dynamic websites with rich interactivity and functionality.
## Week 7
In week 7 I learned event handling and validation, as well as JSON local storage. I learned how to handle user interactions with a webpage and validate user input using JavaScript. Additionally, I learned about JSON local storage and how to use it to store data on the client-side of a browser. With this knowledge, I can create more interactive and user-friendly websites that respond to user input and store data locally for faster load times and better user experience.
## Week 8
In week 8, I learned about jQuery and API implementation. jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies web development by providing built-in animations and event handling functions. I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create dynamic, interactive webpages using jQuery. Additionally, I learned how to use APIs to retrieve data, such as weather forecasts or news articles, and display it on a webpage. This lesson was crucial in teaching me how to create more user-friendly and dynamic webpages using jQuery and API integration.
## Week 9
In week 9, I had an asynchronous lesson where I learned how to use Bootstrap to create a simple About Me page. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that offers pre-built design components that help create responsive and mobile-friendly websites. I learned how to use the grid system, customize components, and style the webpage using CSS. This lesson was valuable in teaching me how to create professional-looking websites that are optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
## Week 12
In week 12, I learned about RestDB, a cloud-based database service that enables developers to create, manage, and host databases for web applications. Using RestDB, I learned how to create and configure databases, define collections, and set access rules and permissions for the database. RestDB provides a user-friendly interface and tools to help developers manage their databases, making it a valuable resource for web development. With this knowledge, I can create more sophisticated web applications that are optimized for user experience.
## Week 13
In week 13, we had a session to rectify common mistakes that were made in our first assignment. This session was important in helping us to learn from our mistakes and improve our web development skills.
## Week 14
In week 14, I learned about Lottie animations in an asynchronous lesson. Lottie is a library that enables developers to add high-quality, scalable animations to web applications with ease. In this lesson, I learned how to use Lottie animations to create visually stunning and engaging web pages. I also learned how to customize and manipulate Lottie animations using JavaScript, allowing for greater control and creative freedom. With this knowledge, I can create more sophisticated and interactive web applications that are optimized for user experience.
